Welcome to my ongoing tutoring semester project! A Notion resource database with study tools (notes, study guides, practice problems, etc) to help my tutees succeed in these popular & high fail rate classes. **NOTE**: Although this database & materials are meant for ESU classes, it is open for viewing by other students as well.

### Background
As a tutor, each semester we are tasked with creating a set of study tools/guides for students in our downtime (any time we are on the clock, but not tutoring students). Since I'm a freelancer for Notion Databases, I decided that making one with a multitude of tools that students in my classes can access at anytime would be a great way to assist every one of my tutees succeed, while also meeting my semester requirement. 


### Tutored Classes
Currently, I tutor for the following Computer Science Classes at my school:
- CPSC 100 - PCs & Their Uses
- CPSC 101 - PCs & Their Uses in Science
- CPSC 102 - Intro Info Mgmt Spreadsheet
- CPSC 130 - Intro to Computer Prog I
- CPSC 131 - Intro to Computer Prog II
- CPSC 141 - Intro to Computer Organization

In the database, there is a page dedicated to each of the classes above, each equipped with it's own set of tools (subjective to the class material). 


### Using Notion
Notion may seem a bit intimidating at first, but I have made this database fairly simple to access and navigate. If you want to  learn about Notion to adopt it for your own use, you can learn more about it at https://www.notion.so/help/start-here. I will update this block throughout the semester, as I make more progress on the database.
