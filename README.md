Welcome to my ongoing tutoring semester project! A Notion resource database with study tools () to help my tutees succeed in these popular & high fail rate classes.

### Background
As a tutor, each semester we are tasked with creating a set of study tools/guides for students in our downtime (any time we are on the clock, but not tutoring students). Since I'm a freelancer for Notion Databases, I decided that making one with a multitude of tools that students in my classes can access at anytime would be a great way to assist every one of my tutees succeed. 

### Tutored Classes
Currently, I tutor for the following Computer Science Classes at my school:
- CPSC 100 - PCs & Their Uses
- CPSC 101 - PCs & Their Uses in Science
- CPSC 102 - Intro Info Mgmt Spreadsheet
- CPSC 130 - Intro to Computer Prog I
- CPSC 131 - Intro to Computer Prog II
- CPSC 141 - Intro to Computer Organization

In the database, there are resources for all of these classes, logically separated,
